/*
    • Write a Java class named Item.
    • Item class has name(String), price(double), amount(int) and total(double) variables.
    • Item class has a constructor which takes name, price and amount as parameters. Calculate total inside Constructor.
    • Item class has also a polymorphic method named ComputeTaxedPrice which returns double.

    • Write two Java classes named Product and Service which are subclasses of Item class.
    • Product and Service classes have also the polymorphic method named ComputeTaxedPrice which applies %18 tax for Product class
      and %1 tax for Service class.

/*
    • Write a Main class and define an 4-element array of type Item class.
    • The first element of array refers to object from Product class.
    • The second element of array refers to object from Service class.
    • The third element of array refers to object from Product class.
    • The fourth element of array refers to object from Service class.
    • Print the total taxed price of Product and Service objects separately.

/*
    • Example Output:
        total taxed price of product: 590000.0
        total taxed price of service: 10100.0
